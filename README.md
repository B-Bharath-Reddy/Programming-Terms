# Programming Terms
Welcome to the Programming Terms repository! This repository contains explanations and examples for various programming terms commonly encountered in software development. Below are brief descriptions of each term covered in this repository:

## Closures
Closures are functions that capture variables from their surrounding lexical scope. They allow functions to access and manipulate variables from outside their own scope.

## Combinations and Permutations
Combinations and permutations are mathematical concepts used in combinatorics to describe different ways of selecting or arranging elements from a set.

## First-Class Functions
In programming languages that support first-class functions, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.

## Generators
Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed. They produce a sequence of values lazily, one at a time, allowing for efficient memory usage.

## Idempotence
An operation is considered idempotent if applying it multiple times has the same effect as applying it once.

## Iterators and Iterables
Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol, allowing them to be iterated over using a loop or comprehension. Iterables are objects that can be iterated over, such as lists, tuples, and strings.

## Memoization
Memoization is an optimization technique used to cache the results of expensive function calls, allowing them to be reused when the same inputs occur again.

## Mutable and Immutable
In programming, mutable objects can be modified after creation, while immutable objects cannot. Immutable objects provide benefits such as thread safety and easier debugging.

## String Interpolation
String interpolation is a feature that allows variables and expressions to be embedded directly within strings, making it easier to create formatted output.

## DRY Code
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a software development principle that encourages code reuse and reduction of duplication. It promotes writing modular, maintainable code by avoiding unnecessary repetition.
